### Test Data Summary

| Entity Type | Source Count | Migrated | Validated | Status |
|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Products | 2,450 | 2,450 | 2,448 | 99.9% |
| Suppliers | 1,200 | 1,198 | 1,198 | 99.8% |
| Legal Entities | 350 | 350 | 350 | 100% |
| Tax Codes | 180 | 180 | 180 | 100% |

### Known Issues

1. Two product records require manual review due to duplicate detection
2. Supplier payment terms converted using default values where missing
3. Historical transaction links preserved via cross-reference table

## Section 4: Data Migration Details

### 4.1 Scope Overview

This section documents the entity mappings established during the migration from
SOURCE to TARGET. All mappings have been validated by the
data stewardship team unless otherwise noted.

### 4.2 Migration Statistics

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Total entities assessed | 170 | Completed |
| Successfully mapped | 16 | Verified |
| Excluded from scope | 4 | Documented |
| Manual review required | 2 | In Progress |

### 4.3 Entity Mapping Reference

#### 4.3.1 Mapping Methodology

Entities were mapped using the following prioritized matching criteria:
1. Exact internal code match (highest confidence)
2. Product specification match (concentration, grade, category)
3. Historical transaction correlation
4. Manual expert review (lowest volume, highest accuracy)

#### 4.3.2 Validated Entity Mappings

The following mappings have been verified by the data governance team and are
considered authoritative for system-of-record purposes. Each mapping includes
the source entity identifier, target entity identifier, and verification notes.

| Source Code (SOURCE) | Target Code (TARGET) | Verification | Notes |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|-------|
| Premier Partners Group | core partners NV | pending_review | Historical match confirmed |
| SIG-25-WDK-CWCD | dextrin tech grade | pending_review | Verified via product specs |
| lactic acid standard | Coconut Oil 98% Lebensmittelrein | auto_generated | Verified via product specs |
| Zitronensäure | fructose standard | auto_generated | Verified via product specs |
| Vat Standardqualität BR 25% | SIG-67-YOR-JCUH | pending_review | Auto-mapped, validated |
| Baltic Processing PLC | SIG-61-SLO-3QQX PLC | unverified | Historical match confirmed |
| Pinnacle Materials | central logistics | pending_review | Cross-referenced with transactions |
| Citric Acid 70% | Traubenzucker Qualitätsstufe I | auto_generated | Verified via product specs |

| WH-GL-ST-378 | Casein | auto_generated | Confirmed by domain expert |
| VA-RE-F-21-230 | SIG-70-QGS-CCAF | auto_generated | Cross-referenced with transactions |
| WH-GL-146 | Lactic Acid 25% Lebensmittelrein | pending_review | Cross-referenced with transactions |
| sorbic acid | Dextrose 25% | pending_review | Auto-mapped, validated |

#### 4.3.3 Excluded Mappings

Mappings excluded from scope per stakeholder decision:

| Source Code | Target Code | Reason for Exclusion |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| NOISE-6524-C | Invalid Entry 685 | Superseded by newer mapping |
| NOISE-4039-E | Invalid Entry 513 | Data quality insufficient |
| NOISE-1379-A | Invalid Entry 302 | Duplicate detected |
| NOISE-2405-B | Invalid Entry 501 | Out of scope per business decision |

#### 4.3.4 Special Handling Notes

Some entities required special handling due to:
- Regional naming variations (German/English translations)
- Legacy code formats incompatible with new system
- Historical product splits or mergers
- Regulatory classification changes

Refer to the entity-specific notes in the mapping table above for details.


## Appendix A: Rollback Procedures

### Scenario 1: Critical Data Corruption

If critical data corruption is detected within 4 hours of migration:

1. Notify incident commander immediately
2. Stop all write operations to target system
3. Execute rollback script: `./scripts/rollback_full.sh --timestamp=20230627_000000`
4. Restore source system from pre-migration backup
5. Communicate status to stakeholders via emergency channel

### Scenario 2: Partial Migration Failure

If specific entity types fail to migrate:

1. Identify failed entity types from migration logs
2. Execute selective rollback: `./scripts/rollback_selective.sh --entity-type=ENTITY_TYPE`
3. Analyze root cause before retry
4. Document issues in post-mortem

### Recovery Time Objectives

| Scenario | RTO | RPO |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Full rollback | 4 hours | 0 data loss |
| Partial rollback | 2 hours | 0 data loss |
| Data correction | 8 hours | Minimal impact |
